# Memory Test Analysis on Drugged Islanders
Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling of memory test performance under different drug conditions

## Project Overview
This project analyzes memory test performance data from islanders subjected to different drug conditions. As someone with a background in Cognitive Neuroscience, I'm particularly interested in understanding how different substances affect cognitive performance, specifically memory recall.

## Research Question
Can we predict memory test scores based on drug type and demographic factors? What insights can we derive about cognitive performance under different substance conditions?
